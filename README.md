Hello!
This is my first project in Javaâ€”a simple calculator that runs on Windows. 
It utilizes various libraries, including JFrame for the window frame, JLabel for display, and JButton for the keys.

This project incorporates basic programming logic, such as if statements, making it a solid introduction to Java programming.
With This program you can understand how opps work and the implementation of connstructors
